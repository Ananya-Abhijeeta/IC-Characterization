# IC-Characterization
This GitHub repository is created to provide hands-on experience in Analog IC Characterization using open-source tools such as NGSpice, Xschem, and the SKY130 PDK.

What is analog Characteriztion
Analog characterization is the process of measuring, simulating, and analyzing the performance parameters of an analog circuit or device (like a MOSFET, amplifier, op-amp, OTA) under different operating conditions.
Characterization is carried out using tools like Ngspice, Spectre, HSPICE, Eldo (Simulation) and Xschem (Schematic) providing a complete framework for accurate simulation and analysis of analog circuits.

1.Linear elements
a)Resistors
A resistor is a passive electronic component that limits or controls the flow of current in a circuit by providing resistance (opposition to current).

👉 Unit: Ohm (Ω)
👉 Symbol: R

Ohm’s Law (Basic Rule)
V=I×R
Main Uses of Resistor

- To Limit Current
- To Divide Voltage,
- To Protect Components
